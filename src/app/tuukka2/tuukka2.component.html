      <p>Santa needs new reindeer. The first bunch has grown old.</p>

      <p>Dasher has arthritis; Comet hates the cold.</p>

      <p>Prancer's sick of staring at Dancer's big behind.</p>

      <p>Cupid married Blitzen and Donder lost his mind.</p>

      <p>Dancer's mad at Vixen for stepping on his toes.</p>

      <p>Vixen's being thrown outâ€” she laughed at Rudolph's nose.</p>

      <p>If you are a reindeer we hope you will apply.</p>

      <p>There is just one tricky part: You must know how to fly.</p>
