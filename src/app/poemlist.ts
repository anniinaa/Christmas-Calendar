    As perfect as could be,
    I thought I’d keep it as a pet,

    I made it some pajamas,

    Then last night it ran away,
    But first - it wet the bed!`,

    had a carrot nose,
    Along came a bunny,

    Grabbed that snowman’s nose,
    Nibble, nibble, crunch!

    From a silver ball
    On the Christmas Tree!

    It was just myself!

    Beside the open grate.
    And now there’s nothing more to do,

    To
    Wait.
